# code
The processing-code (processing-code.Rmd) cleaned and reshaped the raw trap-pair datasets into easier to digest and analyze formats. It standardizes trap identifiers (e.g., oct3_b_a_2 paired with oct3_p_2), parses `date_token`, `pair_num`, and `pair_id`, and converts missing counts to zeros. The script outputs paired, wide datasets with treatment, control, and derived effect sizes (diff, logRR). The processed files are saved to data/processed-data/ as species1.rds, height1.rds and identification1.rds.

I may parse out the processing-code file to make it easier to read. But for now in the early stages it will stay.
