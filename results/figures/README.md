# figures

Folder for all figures. `eda-figures` contains all figures created during the exploratory data analysis portion of this project (Part 2). Future figures will exist in a separate folder under a different name.

Copies of figures are also placed in `eda-assets` as they appeared to load in awkwardly. This may be removed in the future.
