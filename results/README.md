# results

This folder and subfolders contain results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

`/figures/eda-figures/` contains all figures created from `edacode.R`.
`/figures/tables/` contains all tables and lms created from `edacode.R` in the form of .png and .rds files.
`/eda-assets` under MADA-PROJECT contain copies of `eda-figures` at this time.

To save the figures and tables, the code must be run in `edacode.R`. It can be run sequentially.
