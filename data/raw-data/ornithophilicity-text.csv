Mn. Dyari --> 38% bloodmeals on American crows in Canada (Shahhosseini et al 2021) but primarily feeds on turtles,,,
American robin was the most common source of vertebrate blood for Cx. pipiens (38%) and Cx. restuans (37%). (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3291451/),,,
Cx pipiens and restuans suspected to be 'more efficient enzootic vectors in northeast US (same as above source),,,
punctipennis fed on ~ 5.8% bird in blood meal analysis (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1948-7134.2014.12066.x),,,
