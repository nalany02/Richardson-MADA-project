# processed-data

This folder contains data that has been processed and cleaned by code.

Any files located in here are based on the raw data and can be re-created running the various processing/cleaning code scripts in the `code` folder. I ran all code in `processing-code` concurrently, though you could also extract each individual file and run them with their respective chunks. For example, I read and loaded in all of my data and created data locations first, but you could do them one at a time.
